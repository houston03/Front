    <p>Death Stranding takes place in a post-apocalyptic future. Many years ago, the United States and the rest of the world were devastated by a disaster known as "Death Stranding". This catastrophe is connected with the existence of life after death: every person, in addition to the mortal body ("Ha"), has an immortal soul ("Ka"). During life, they are connected, but after the death of the body, the soul enters the individual afterlife of the Beach, from which it can move to unknown worlds beyond it. Each person has their own Shore, although in the case of the death of many people at the same time.</p>
